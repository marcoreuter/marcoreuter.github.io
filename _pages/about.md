I am a Digital Money Economist in the macro finance division of the research department at the [International Monetary Fund](https://www.imf.org/). 

My research interests are Blockchains and Crypto Assets, Digital Money, and their economic implications. I have received my Ph.D. from the [University of Mannheim](https://www.vwl.uni-mannheim.de/en/) in 2023. Previously, I was a researcher in the Market Design Department at the [ZEW](https://www.zew.de/en/).

You can find the latest version of my CV [here](assets/pdf/cv.pdf).
